      <h2>Shell, Terminal, Console…?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The german translation for <strong>shell</strong> is: “Schale” or
        “Hülle”. It’s the outer layer, so it’s the the interface between the
        human and the machine. A shell is the program that the terminal sends
        user input to. The shell generates output and passes it back to the
        terminal for display.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>terminal</strong> displays output on the screen and accepts
        input from the keyboard. The terminal needs another program to run that
        input. That program is the <strong>shell</strong>.<br />
        It’s also calles command-line-interface (CLI)
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>console</strong> (command line) is a text-based application
        to edit, watch and manipulate files on the machine. It’s similar to the
        Windows Explorer, but without the GUI.
      </p>

      <p>
        Technically (and historically) the <strong>Console</strong> is the
        device and the <strong>Terminal</strong> is the software program inside
        the Console.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>Commands and flags</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you want to manipulate your computer in any way, you run commands in
        the CLI.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can do basicially everything in the CLI like you could do with an
        Graphical User Interface (GUI). For chaining commands and repititive
        tasks it’s even better, because you can automate them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Flags allow you to make the command more precise. For example if you
        want to see the the files of the directory you’re currentyl in, type
        <strong>ls</strong> as command, and <strong>-a</strong> for “all”. This
        will show you all files, included the hidden ones.
