      <h2>Basic principles</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        It’s a tool that can save your project if you messed it up. That
        mechanism is called “Version Control”.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can see it as a rope in rock climbing. It can bring you back to a
        state you were before and start over again if you felt like you took a
        wrong direction. Another good picture is the “Time Machine”.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can work on multiple <strong>branches</strong> (Entwicklungszweige).
        This will not touch the main branch, Later on, if you are happy with
        your yode, you can merge it in the main branch. Imagine it as a tree. Or
        parallel lines.
      </p>

      <h2>States</h2>

      <h2>Add, Commit, Push</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        They are similar in a way. They push your files to the next stage (see
        picture above).<br />
        Differences:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Adding: You can choose the files you want to add. If you added a file
          you don’t want to have, do <strong>git reset</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Commit & Push: Takes all the files from the current stage to the next
          stage. One of the key approaches with Git is that commits are focused,
          small and frequent.
        </li>
        <li>Every commit has it’s own hash(number)</li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <h1>What about Github?</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Github is the place where you host the gits and make them public. So you
        can work on it as a team.
